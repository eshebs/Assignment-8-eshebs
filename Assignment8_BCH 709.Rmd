This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


First things first, set up and get data
```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
data("gapminder")
```

Looking at data overall summary
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```



mean of one column of data, gdpPercap
```{r}
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)
x <- mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

attach function and population median
```{r}
attach(gapminder)
median(pop)
```



histograms of lifeExp and population using log
```{r}
hist(lifeExp)
hist(log(pop))
```



Box and whisker plot with values segregated by continent using ~
```{r}
boxplot(lifeExp ~ continent)
```



using ~ to separate x and y axis. (x ~ y)
plot meaning scatter plot for life expectancy vs gdp per capita
```{r}
plot(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap))
```



select, group, filter, summarise data
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, lifeExp) %>% 
  filter(country == "South Africa" | 
          country == "Ireland") %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(Average_life = mean(lifeExp))
```



making first data frame df1

```{r}
df1 <- gapminder %>% 
  select(country, lifeExp) %>% 
  filter(country == "South Africa" | country == "Ireland")
```



t test of df1
```{r}
t.test(data = df1, lifeExp ~ country)
```


Now begin using ggplot2
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```


life expectancy vs gdp per capita on scatterplot with colors for each continent
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap < 50000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, col=continent, size=pop))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth()
```



Same plot as above, put dot size represents population of the country, linear with log and geom smooth and separating the continents using facet wrap, and color represents year and not continents
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap < 50000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log(gdpPercap), y=lifeExp, col=year, size=pop))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```




```{r}
summary(lm(gapminder$lifeExp ~ gapminder$gdpPercap+gapminder$pop))
```
